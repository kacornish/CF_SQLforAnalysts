Develop SQL skills and explore databases

I’ve been hired as a data analyst by Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI)
department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. The BI
department helps other departments, from inventory to customer insights, with data-related
queries. My first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database
management system (RDBMS). Then, I’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
